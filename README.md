This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Ruby.
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to make a move by choosing a number from 1 to 9.
The grid is displayed after each move.
The game continues until there's a winner or it's a draw.
The game will notify you if you attempt to make an invalid move.
The first player is 'X', and the second player is 'O'.
